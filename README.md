# Oilburner
This small mod introduces some fluidtank like object, the oilburner, which 'destroys' or rather 'burns' oil related fluids.
Basicly it destroys any incoming oil without any result or any advantage directly.
It was supposed to help players, if they want to keep the refinery running for example when you are producing solid fuel from petroleum, but you don't use the other oil types and you still want the refinery to keep producing petrolium, you now can use the oilburner on the other pipes to remove the fluids.

As of now the oilburner does not need any sort of energy/or either has a specific 'burnrate'.
These are planned to be added, when i get some sparetime.

Any suggestions are appreciated.
P.S.: I enjoyed making this first mod and hope to continue developing so the Factorio community can grow.
Have fun!
